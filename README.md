# 🌦️ Live Weather Dashboard - India

## 📊 Project Summary

This project is a *comprehensive weather monitoring dashboard* built for multiple Indian cities. It is designed to handle *large volumes of live streaming data, efficiently visualizing real-time weather and air quality metrics across cities like **Ahmedabad, **Amritsar, **Asansol, **Barasat, **Bengaluru, **Bhopal*, and many more.

By leveraging streaming data APIs and intelligent data processing techniques, the system presents critical atmospheric insights in a clean and visually appealing format suitable for both analytical use and public display.



## 🚀 Key Highlights

- *Real-Time Streaming*: Continuously receives and processes live weather data across several Indian locations.
- *Multi-City Support*: Dynamically switches between cities like Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Asansol, Barasat, Bengaluru, Bhopal, etc.
- *Data-Intensive Dashboard*: Handles large data streams and renders complex visual elements with minimal latency.
- *Smart Aggregation*: Transforms high-frequency data into meaningful summaries, trends, and predictions.



## 🌐 Data Sources

- Weatherapi API key



## 🧠 Dashboard Insights

### 📍 *City-Level Stats*
- Current temperature, weather condition (e.g., Mist, Cloudy)
- UV Index, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation
- Atmospheric Pressure, Visibility

### 📅 *7-Day Forecast Trends*
- Interactive line chart for daily maximum temperature
- Forecasts from real-time prediction models

### 🌅 *Sun Timings*
- Daily sunrise and sunset times

### 🌧️ *Chance of Rain*
- Hourly/daily rain probability indicators (city-specific)

### 🌫️ *Air Quality Index*
- Overall AQI status with color-coded severity
- Pollutant breakdown:
  - PM10
  - PM2.5
  - CO (Carbon Monoxide)
  - SO₂, NO₂, O₃



## 📦 Backend Logic

- *Data Ingestion*: Pulls data continuously via streaming API.
- *ETL Pipeline: Processes incoming streaming data using Power BI’s data modeling layer — applying **calculated columns* for enrichment, *new measures* for aggregations, and *DAX* for complex business logic and dynamic calculations.
- *Power BI*: Renders data into responsive charts, graphs, and widgets.
